<h1>Chapters</h1>

<p>
These chapters are about the Korea I remember as a 10 year old girl and all the drawings are from memory.  Sometimes I wonder how I can still remember this trip so clearly.  I think it's because I've replayed this trip in my head for years after when I couldn't be there.  I hope they will kindle nostalgia of your own.

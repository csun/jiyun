When I was 10 years old I took a trip back to Seoul for the summer. It was the 1970's, a time when you could fly halfway around the world and feel like you had gone somewhere different. Life was slower, quieter, and most Americans and Koreans still didn't know a lot about each other.

My parents moved to America for my father's job when I was an infant. I stayed with my grandparents in Seoul until age six when I joined my parents in New York. I missed my grandparents and nanny very much and this story is a collection of everyday moments and observations from that trip.

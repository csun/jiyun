<p>Jiyun's Korea takes place in the 1970s, a time when you could fly halfway around the world and feel like you had gone somewhere different.  The world was bigger, life was slower, quieter, and most Americans and Koreans still didn't know a lot about each other.  This story is a collection of moments from a young girl's summer.</p>

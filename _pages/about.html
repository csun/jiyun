<p>Jane Youn is a long time resident of the San Francisco Bay Area but has lived on different coasts throughout the years. Jiyun's Korea is a project that has been trying for decades to find a way to reveal itself. It is an experimental work-in-progress that uses some simple animation.</p>

<p>Jiyun's Korea is an autobiographical story about a trip she took back to Seoul for the summer when she was ten years old. It was the 1970s, a time when you could fly halfway around the world and feel like you had gone somewhere different. The world was bigger, life was slower, quieter, and most Americans and Koreans still didn't know a lot about each other.</p>

<p>The story is a collection of everyday moments and observations from the trip. All the drawings are from memory.</p>

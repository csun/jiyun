<p>Jane Youn is a long time resident of the San Francisco Bay Area.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jiyun's Korea</i> is an autobiographical story about a summer trip she took when she was ten years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is a collection of everyday moments and observations from the trip, and all the drawings are from memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an experimental work-in-progress and some pages have simple animation.</p>

<p><i>Jiyun's Korea</i> takes place in the 1970s, a time when you could fly halfway around the world and feel like you had gone somewhere different.&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was bigger, life was slower, quieter, and most Americans and Koreans still didn't know a lot about each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a formative time for Jiyun and for the two countries.</p>

This is an illustrated story about a summer trip I took to Seoul, Korea, when I was 10 years old.  It was the 1970's, a time when you could fly halfway around the world and feel like you had gone somewhere different.  The pace of life was slower, quieter, and most Americans and Koreans still didn't know a lot about each other.

It was an unforgettable summer because it was a homecoming as well as a departure again.  My parents moved to New York for my father's job when I was an infant and I stayed in Seoul where I was raised by my grandparents and nanny until age six.  When I joined my parents in New York, I wished I could go back to Seoul.  This was that trip back home for me.  I remember keeping track of the days that summer.  Two and a half months sounds like a long time but knowing it would end, every day was very precious.  I think that is why I can remember things about this trip in such detail.

This is a story I've been trying to tell since that summer.  Other than the beginning and the ending, my story is a collection of everyday things and as such, doesn't fit the conventional format of a story.  It is illustrated and suitable for children but it is not a children's book.  With the programming help of my son, Cameron, I decided to try and forge a different type of story.

It is an evolving work-in-progress so chapters will be added as they are completed.  This is a labor of love during non-working hours so it may take a while for new chapters to appear.

I hope you enjoy it!
